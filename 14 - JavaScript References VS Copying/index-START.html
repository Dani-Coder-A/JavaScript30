    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);

    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = "Dani";
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);

    name = "A"
    console.log(name, name2);



    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    //team[3] = "Lux";
    //console.log(players, team);  

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    //Since team is a reference to the original array players, when team changes so does the original array it is referencing 
    //Arrays update unlike strings, numbers, and booleans example

    
    
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log(team2);

    const team3 = players.slice(2, 3);
    console.log(team3);

    console.log(players);

    team2[3] = "Lux";
    console.log(team2);
    console.log(players);



    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team4 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(team4);



    // or use the new ES6 Spread or the Array.from()
    const team5 = [...players];
    team5[3] = "Dani";
    console.log(team5);
    console.log(players);

    const team6 = Array.from(players);
    team6[3] = "cool";
    console.log(team6);
    console.log(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed



    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    // and think we make a copy:
    //const captain = person;
    //captain.number = 99;
    //console.log(captain);
    //console.log(person);
    //The original object updates as well



    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2);
    console.log(person);



    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    console.log(person);



    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: "Wes",
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: "@wesbos",
        facebook: "wesbos.developer"
      }
    };

    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes, { name: "Wesley" });
    console.log(dev);
    console.log(wes);

    const dev2 = Object.assign({}, wes)
    dev2.social.twitter = "@coolman";  //This changes the original object as well because it only goes 1 level deep
    console.log(dev2);
    console.log(wes);

    const dev3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));  //This changes multiple levels deep but doesn't change original object. Not recommended.
